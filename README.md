# fakeTime
Dedicated to exploring the use of a fake time algorithm in Quantum Mechanics with various languages.

The main program is currently written in Python and can solve any two-dimensional system that can be
discretized onto a rectangular grid. Current plans are to rewrite the primary algorithm in Rust along
with the Helium atom code.
